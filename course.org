* Course Goal:
  Improve your ability to use your computer as a tool for academic activities.

  This leads to the following learning objectives
* Learning Objectives:
    - Learn how to install software.
    - Learn how to work from the command line.
    - Learn the rudiments of programming sufficient to allow further progress through self study.
    - Learn about the use of libraries to enable programming psychological experiments.
    - Learn how to use version control
    - Learn how to write papers that blend code and analyses to generate reproducible research reports.      
      This includes learning
      - how to use citation databases
      - generate graphics of analyses
      - conduct statistical analyses
      - generate multiple output formats from a single source file. 
* Course Mechanics
  To meet the learning objectives you will need to *do* more than you listen or observe. You will also need to break old habits. That means in the beginning it will be harder to do simple things. It also means that in the future things that used to be impossible for you to do will now be possible (but they may still not be easy). Combining computer skills with with your psychology content knowledge makes you more attractive to employers and on a graduate school application. 

  Thus, this course will require you to use the Linux operating system (the XUbuntu flavor) and tools available within that space. Later on, after this course, if you wish to return to the world of OSX and Windows10 you will know what you are looking for, and you will have the skills necessary to make it available. 
* Outline
** Session 1 Installing Linux
*** Instructions for testing the Live CD and installing to USB
   2. Learn how to boot your computer from a USB. 
      - Mac OSX - start the computer with option key held down
      - Windows - may require going into the bios and enable booting usb (usually some key combo of F2 or F10 during the boot process - look for a very briefly flashed screen); followed by rebooting with a different F Key. Another option is to tell Windows to boot from recovery mode. Find the "advanced" menu of the Windows Start Up menu (look in the "recovery" section of the start-up). Select from "another device". Some devices, like Surfaces, have other key combinations.
      - Other systems: chrome books; ipads; probably won't work.
      - Sometimes it takes a while to figure out which of the options is the Xubuntu option. If one doesn't work, just note what it was and next time try a different one. 
   3. Run an XUbuntu Live CD
      If problems starting the use without installing option, restart, select install, and then quit from the first screen. That will usually drop you into what you need.
   4. Explore the Live USB
      1. Connect to the wifi.
         1. Click up/down arrow in upper right corner of screen.
         2. Select the correct options (to be demonstrated).
            - Authentication: PEAP
            - Click box no certificate required
            - Use your full watiam address (including the stuff after @ sign usually).
      2. Verify working by opening Firefox Web Browser
         1. Click little icon upper left.
         2. From dropdown menu select /Web Browser/.
         3. Go to https://uwaterloo.ca
      3. Explore some of the other programs available in the dropdown menu and under the different headings.
         1. Which program is like Word for Windows?
         2. How do you take a screenshot?
         3. What is the standard email program on this version of Linux?
      4. Installing programs
         There is a "gui" installer, but we are going to use the package management system from the command line.
         1. Open the terminal emulator
         2. type ~sudo apt update~
            What does /sudo/ mean?
         3. Do *NOT* upgrade your old packages at this point.
         4. type ~sudo apt install emacs~ ; accept the defaults
         5. Leave the terminal open but drag over to the menu in the upper left corner and inspect the /Development/ folder. You should emacs in there. Do *not* click it. We are going to launch from the command line.
         6. Back in terminal type: ~emacs &~.
            What does the ampersand do? It lets things run in the background without freezing the terminal. If you don't know what I mean, then start without the ampersand, and then try to type another command in the terminal. Remember: if you don't know what will happen? Try it (after maybe backing up important files).
         7. Go to the emacs help menu and under the drop down options pick emacs psychotherapist. Remember it is here when you need some counselling in the first few sessions of this course.
   5. Syllabus review (short break). 
   6. Problems with the live "CD". 
      Nothing is permanent. All your upgrades and installations vanish everytime you turn it off and you would have to do it all over again everytime you restart. So, I want you to install Xubuntu so that any changes you make will be persistent, but since I don't want to require you to alter your personnel machine, will will install it to a usb and you will then run your computer from this new, second, usb where the changes you make will persist.
   7. Install Linux XUbuntu to a second USB
      This will be the major goal of the rest of our session. Follow the prompts on the screen. Work together. Ask questions. 
      
      **Where you need to be careful**

      When you are picking where to install the system you need to make sure to pick the new USB location. It will probably be /dev/sd<something or other>. If you pick the wrong device you will install it in place of your current operating system. Try running, from a terminal, =ls /dev/sd* = without the usb in place. Then plug in the USB and note the new appearance of the another ~/dev/sd<something>~. 

      When you pick where to install the /bootloader/ make sure you also pick the USB or you may have trouble booting into your old system the way you are used too. 
   8. When you think you are done, shut things down. Remove the live USB/CD, but leave the other one in place. Follow the steps you need to to boot your computer from a USB. If you are able to launch Ubuntu (and it might take a few tries to find the right menu entry) then you will see linux start. Enjoy the feeling of immense power.
   9. Boot your computer from the /new/ USB and install *emacs* /from the command line/ again.
      1. The command line - open up a "terminal". Your terminal will be running a "shell."
      2. Package Managers
         1. The ubuntu package manager
            Basic commands: 
            - apt update
            - apt install 
            - apt search
            - apt remove
   10. This time you might want to update those old programs. 
*** Troubleshooting
    - I don't have a USB port? :: Do you have an sdcard port? Yes? You can use that. If you have neither you will need a different computer. It can be a cheap (as in the price of textbook cheap) and old one.
    - I only have one USB port. :: Can you work with a neighbor to repeat the installation instructions on a second USB that you can use on your machine? If not, you may need something like this. 
         #+Caption: USB Port Expander
       #+Name: USBPortExpndPic
       #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
       [[https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81j1TYALbYL._SL1500_.jpg]]
    - Can I just install Linux on my computer? :: You certainly can, and you can even keep you "old" operating system and use one or the other as you choose. But this seemed more than I could require of all students, but I encourage you to do it if you are willing. First, **back up everything** because trying this and getting it wrong could cause you to lose all your saved information. 
    - I already use Linux. :: Good for you. Help a classmate.
    - What is Linux? :: Check wikipedia.
    - Why use Xubuntu? :: Is it different from Ubuntu (Debian, Arch, Fedora, OpenSuse...)? Linux is a kernel that powers the system. All the rest are different choices people make of the tools they want to wrap around that "engine." XUbuntu is a reasonably light-weight linux distribution that runs well on slow machines, and yet has enough of a user base to make it reasonably easy to find help on line.
*** Homework
    1. Send me a screenshot of emacs open and running on your laptop.
       Hints: look for xfce4-screenshooter to take the screenshot. Log on to /Learn/ while running linux. Of course that will require you to connect to the internet, and that will require you repeating those steps to configure the connection.
    2. Look at the available software applications and download one (1). Don't go crazy on this. You are running your whole computer from a small usb, it will already be slow, and you will already be limited for space. Just find one program (look for "software" in the upper left corner icon drop down menu) that strikes you as cool or interesting and install it, play with it, and write a one-paragraph description of it using this format:
       
       #+Attr_HTML: :textarea t :width 40
       #+Begin_example
       * Package Name
         My Package
       ** Short Description
          A package for something.
       ** Review
          I liked it because ... and so on.
       #+END_Example

       Save it with yourlastname-firstname_pkgname.org as the file name. Upload it to the dropbox on learn. And save it, because you will need it again soon. 

       Use the program "mousepad" for the above. 
** Session 2 Command Line Basics and EMACS Introduction
*** Command Line
**** What is it?
**** Why use it? [[https://www.quora.com/How-important-is-it-to-learn-command-line-interfaces/answers/1620528][One opinion.]]
***** The [[http://write.flossmanuals.net/command-line/introduction/][Manual]]
**** Find your terminal?
     Why is it called the terminal?
***** Operating Systems
      - Windows
        - [[https://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/][CMD]]
        - [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6][Power Shell]]
        - [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10][WSL]] 
          If you use this I recommend you install the Ubuntu version. That is
          the one that I know the most about from the options. Note that
          this will give you access to command line tools, but not to
          graphical tools.
        - **Recommended** If you have windows 10 you can run linux as a
          [[https://www.windowscentral.com/how-run-linux-distros-windows-10-using-hyper-v][virtual machine]].
      - OSX
        - Applications/Utilities/Terminal
        - Why don't you have to install a virtual machine to get linux commands on OSX?
      - Linux 
        - probably xterm
**** Terminal Games
     1. ~ls -la /home/<username>~
        - What does all this output mean?
        - What changes when you leave out the ~-la~?
        - What does the hyphen do?
     2. Find the location of your Desktop folder.
     3. Change to that directory.
        ~cd~
     4. Find out where you are?
        ~pwd~
     5. Find out how much free space you have on your computer disk.
        ~df -h~
     6. How do you get help for most of these commands?
        Usually ~command --help~ or (~-h~)
     7. How do you find the manual?
        ~man ls~
     8. Navigating
        1. Paths: absolute and relative.
        2. What do those "dots" mean?
        3. What do those slashes mean?
        4. Tab is your friend.
        5. Try the up arrow too.
     9. File ownership
        1. Make a text file from the command line.
           ~touch /home/yourname/Documents/testText.txt~
        2. Who owns it?
     10. Make a directory
         ~mkdir /home/britt/Documents/myFirstDir/~
         
         Spaces are the enemy. Never use them, but if you have to, escape (~\~) them.
     11. Want more practice? Try the tutorials [[https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php][here]].
*** Exercises Emacs
**** Emacs
     1. What are Control and Meta used for? What keys are they?
        May depend on your keyboard and operating system. Don't like what they are? [[https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/man/man1/xmodmap.1.xhtml][Remap them]]. 
     2. Tutorial ~Ctrl-h t~ (aka =C-h t=)
     3. Find the Psychotherapist - you may need it.
     4. Play a game - try ~M-x tetris~
     5. Init files and packages. 
        Emacs has it's own package system that allows you to greatly expand its functionality. Most of those customization are set up in your =~/.emacs.d/init.el= file. Create it if it doesn't exist. 
        You can learn more by reading the [[info:emacs#Init%20File][info file]].
        A minimal init.el to get started

        #+begin_src elisp :eval never :exports code
        (require package)
        (package-initialize)
        (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages") t)
        #end_src


     6. Program your editor
        1. Turn off the tool bar?
        2. How? ~C-h-f~ will allow you to search for functions. Try the keyword menu and tab and see if you come across a likely contender (~menu-bar-showhide-tool-bar-menu-customize-disable~).
        3. Navigate to the scratch buffer. Put that function in parantheses. Move to the end. Type ~C-x C-e~. Did your tool bar go away?
        4. Point is that you can heavily customize your editor. Don't worry too much about it for now. 
     7. [[info:org#Top][Orgmode]]
        1. What is it? About the best thing ever.
        2. Make an outline. Keep a calendar. Add code to your documents. Make links. Include images.
        3. Practice now:
           Where is the help, remember? ~C-h i~
           Note bene: may need to get ~sudo apt install emacs25-common-non-dfsg~ for all the documentation. 
           1. Learn to use the short cuts to open, save, and so on. That is one of the powers of the command line and similar style tools. Enhance your productivity and control. 
           2. Create an outline.
           3. Create a link
           4. Insert an image
           5. Export as a web page.
           6. What would you need to export a pdf?
              Try installing ~texlive-latex-recommended~. If that doesn't fix the problem go with ~texlive-full~. This is big.
** Session 3 Version Control Github and Beginning With Python
*** Version Control
**** Git
     **Not** the same as Github, though that is one of the more common /social/ uses of git for sharing and collaborating on code. 
**** Social Coding and Data Sharing
     A brief discussion of what is going on here.
***** OSF.io
      1. Sign up
      2. Find my projects
**** Installation of Git
     ~sudo apt install git~
**** Github and Gitlab and Bitbucket and ...
     1. Github is the big one with a large external presence.
        1. Sign-up
     2. The university provides you with a gitlab presence at [[https://git.uwaterloo.ca]]
**** Git
     1. Open a terminal
     2. Move (~cd~ or ~dir~) into your Desktop
     3. type =git init myrepo=
     4. Should see message from the terminal prompt that it has been created.
     5. Feel free to delete (e.g. =rm -rf ./myrepo=)
**** Making and Cloning a Course Repo
     1. I create an empty repository on github
     2. I create a repository on my laptop.
     3. I add some small file.
     4. I set the upstream (origin) as the github site, and then I push.
     5. Now if I use a different computer I can push and pull (to be discussed) from this github site and keep everything synced together. 
**** Magit
     1. Emacs provides you with an interface for this called magit.
     2. To use it you will have to create an init file (and delete ~/.emacs)
        Let's you discover the hidden directories.
     3. You will have to enable emacs package repositories (everyone in linux land has a package manager).
     4. You will need to install the magit package.
     5. Then it is ~C-c m~ or ~M-x magit~
**** Forks and Clones and Pull Requests  :homework:
     1. Diagram the logic on the board.
     2. Get everyone to create a fork of the course repository
     3. Get everyone to create a local clone on their laptop
     4. Set a second upstream pointing to me.
     5. Pull from my repo to laptop.
     6. Update and accept the changes.
     7. Push this to your fork.
     8. Add a new file to your laptop version.
     9. Push this to your fork.
     10. From github generate a pull request for me. This is one of this weeks homeworks. 
*** Beginning Python
**** Python
     1. Test for Python in a terminal.
        - open a terminal
        - type ~python --version~ then ~enter~
        - If you see an answer you have python. Type ~python~. Note the cursor has changed.
        - type ~2 + 2 enter~
        - Do you see 4?
        - type ~quit()~ to exit.
        - Why do you need to have the parentheses after the word quit?
     2. If you only have version 2 try the command again with ~python3 --version~.
     3. If you don't have python3, get it.
**** Coding - General
     Coding - providing instructions to a computer.
     The computer only does what you tell it. 
**** Writing Code
     Code files are just plain text. You can open and write them in anything, though some tools can make the writing substantially easier. Usually extensions identify a language (e.g. .py for python and .R for R). 
**** Testing Code
***** Interactive
      We already did a little of this, but let's try again.
      #+begin_src python :session *pythonPractice* :export code :results silent
        def myadd(a,b):
            return(a+b)
      #+end_src

      #+begin_src python :results output :exports both :session *pythonPractice*
        print(myadd(3,4))
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : 7

      For interactive session it is like you are interacting with a user. You type your lines one or a few at a time, get an answer, and then decide what to do next. 
***** Script
      You write a separate file that you read in, or import and use. Here is the file.

      #+include: "./code/testScript.py"

      #+begin_src python :results output :exports both :session *pythonPractice*
        from code.testScript import *

        print(add2(3,4))

        print(addMany([1,2,3,4,5,6]))
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : Python 3.7.3 (default, Jun 24 2019, 04:54:02) 
      : [GCC 9.1.0] on linux
      : Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      : 7
      : 21
      : python.el: native completion setup loaded

      Try creating this file and then typing these commands in your terminal. For various weird reasons if you want the test script to be in a subdirectory of where you are working you will need a file =__init__.py= to trick python into treating it as a package. See the [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages][documentation]] and this [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1260792/import-a-file-from-a-subdirectory][stackOverflow answer]].
**** Confirming You Can Write and Run a Python File :homework:
     1. Create a file ~lastname.py~
     2. Write the myadd function I demonstrated, but give it a different name.
     3. Save.
     4. Open up a terminal.
     5. Start a python session.
     6. Import your file with you function.
     7. Use your function.
     8. Take a screenshot of your terminal session showing the above session.
     9. Submit that for your homework *along
** Session 4 Python 
*** Types
    - Integers :: 1, 2, ...
    - Doubles/Floats :: 10.3, pi
    - Booleans :: True , False 
                  NB: some languages, e.g. R, use TRUE. 
    - Lists and Tuples
      - Tuples :: (1,2), ('a',10.34,False) Have a fixed number of slots, can be different types.
                  Define with parentheses
      - Lists  :: [1,2,3,4] Have a potentially infinite number of slots, but must all be same type.
                  Define with square brackets.
    - Dictionaries :: {'firstName' : 'Britt', 'lastName' : 'Anderson'}      
    - Comments :: Not really code, but allows you to put stuff in your programs for other users and yourself to read. In python the lines start with a hash "#"
*** Constants and Variables
    A conceptual difference more than a implementation difference
    #+begin_src python :exports both :results value :session *pythonPractice*
      NOHRSDAY = 24

      x = NOHRSDAY

      x
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 24

**** Coding styles
     Makes your code easier to read by people using the same language.
     
     Try to follow good programming style, and if avaialable, langugage guides.

     [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/][Python Style Guide]]
*** Assignment and Equality
    ~=~ is different from ~==~

 #+begin_src python :results output :exports both
 a = 2
 print(a == 3)
 #+end_src

 #+RESULTS:
 : False
 
*** Loops
    Think of recipes: "stir egg whites until peaked" or "simmer for 30 minutes". That is the intuition for a 
**** For 
     Python refers to things called "iterables." To iterate is another way of saying something you can keep doing the same thing over and over to. Imagine a bowl of ice cream. It is "eatable". You take one spoon, and keep taking spoonfuls until the bowl is empty. 
***** Indexing
      You can get the location of an element in a list by referring to its /index/. Indexes start at 0 for many computer languages, but not all (e.g. R and Matlab). There are various shorthands for getting ranges of elements or the last element.

      #+Name: Indexing
      #+begin_src python :session *pythonPractice* :exports both :results output
        nameDict = {'firstName' : 'Britt', 'lastName' : 'Anderson'}
        mylist = list(range(1,10))

        print(nameDict['firstName'])

        print(mylist)

        print(mylist[0])

        print(mylist[-1])

***** For Class Exercise
      1. Create a list of at least 8 individual characters.
      2. Make sure they are **not** in alphabetical order
      3. Print the letters one at a time.
      4. Print the letters sorted alphabetically one at a time, but /do not/ overwrite your original list.
      5. Print the letters from both lists with a format command that says which position the letter is in.

**** While
     These are like for loops in that they do stuff over and over, but unlike for loops they do things indefinitely, until that is, you tell them to stop. How do you do that? You use a predicate that they test for each time through the loop. That means you need to specify a /predicate./
***** Conditionals
      This is where you test whether something is or is not ~True~. Note that Python, but not all computer languages, treats 0 as the same as False, and all non-zero values as True. 

      #+begin_src python :exports code  :session *pythonPractice* :results output
        if (2 == 3):
            print("Wha.....?\n\n")
        elif (3 == 2):
            print("Now that is odd")
        else:
            print("2 does not equal 3.")
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      : 2 does not equal 3.
***** While
      NB: note the use of colon (:) at the end of the =for= and =while= lines. 
      #+begin_src python :exports both :session *pythonPractice: :results output
        i = 0
        while (i<=10):
            print("brittAnderson"[i])
            i = i+1
          #+end_src

*** Functions
    You have seen an example of this before. Think of a function as a machine that grinds meat. You pour in a cow. You get out hamburger. Input. Output. Note that arguments are "local". They are not referring to variables outside, in the program globally, but only make sense locally in the function. You drop values into those slots, and they you can use those names  in your function, because until you use it, your function doesn't know what it will be getting. 
 #+begin_src python :exports code  :session *pythonPractice*
 def myadd(x,y):
    return(x+y)
 #+end_src

 #+RESULTS:

 #+begin_src python :exports both :results output :session *pythonPractice*
 myadd(2,3)
 #+end_src

 #+RESULTS:
 : 5

**** Class Exercise with Functions :homework:
     You will be required to turn this in, but you can get started now. 
     1. Look up how to get user input from python on the command line.
     2. Write a script that I will run on the command line thus:
        ~python functionHW.py~
     3. Your script should ask me to enter a word.
     4. It will then print out the word.
     5. Print out the sorted version one character at a time.
     6. Ask me if I want to do it again (y/n). If 'y', repeat, and continue repeating until I answer 'n'.
*** Libraries :classdiscussion:
    Lots of people use python. If you can think that someone ought to have done ... they probably have. Use libraries whenever you can, because ... discussion points. 
**** What are some popular libraries? :classactivity:homework:
     [[https://pythontips.com/2013/07/30/20-python-libraries-you-cant-live-without/][Here]] are 20 recommended ones.
     
     Of particular note for us are:
     1. Numpy
     2. Scipy
     3. Matplotlib
     4. Pillow
     5. Sympy

     Divide class into small groups. Assign a library. Have them present to us what it is good for, and maybe a short demo. 
     
     Homework: Submit a short .py script to the class github repo that demonstrates the importation of your library and some basic use. 
*** Programs
    Nothing else really, but the more prolonged and complicated concatenation of the above. 
*** Debugging and Basic Working Methods
    The most basic is just to ~print~ statements into your code so that you can see what happening and whether your variables are actually what you think they should be. 
*** IDEs
    What does IDE stand for?

    What are common IDEs for python and how do you get them. What are they good for. 

    Two popular ones are:
    1. Spyder
    2. pyCharm

    This is what you need to use for this course: emacs.
    1. Open up a blank file with a name that ends in .py
    2. Type in some lines (e.g. a = 2, b = 3, print(a+b))
    3. Type C-c C-c on the first line.
    4. Read the error message
    5. Fix it.
    6. Keep C-c C-c'ing on each line and look at what is happening in your console.
    7. When your cursor is on a python word, like ~print~, look in the mode line.
    8. Try M-x linum-mode
    9. To see some fancier stuff install the ~elpy~ package for emacs.
       1. M-x package-list-packages
       2. C-s elpy
       3. type "i"
       4. type "x"
    10. An easier way to get and maintain your emacs package is "use-package". See some instructions [[https://elpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#overview][here]].
    11. When you try ~(elpy-enable)~ you will get error messages. Why? You don't have all the dependencies.
    12. Uninstall elpy (go to that list and hit 'd' on the elpy package).
    13. Follow instructions [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][here]] to see what python packages you need and install them.
    14. What no pip? Welcome to the world of using your computer (and dependency hell). 
        #+begin_src sh :eval never :exports code
          sudo apt install python-pip
          pip install jedi rope flake8 autopep8 yapf black
        #+end_src
    15. Then reinstall elpy. Whoooo - wipes brow.
    16. No! Needs to be for python3. Repeat all the above for python3 and then customize your emacs python shell command like this
        #+begin_src sh :eval never :exports code
        M-x customize-variable python-shell-interpreter
        #+end_src
    17. Check out the elpy [[https://elpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#overview][documentation]]. Lots of cool features to make your programming easier. 

    Why do you have to do all this? Because Mama a'int spoon feeding you anymore boys and girls. 

    
*** Pip to Install Libraries and Virtual Environments

**** Pip
     pip is the python install package program. There have been many ways to install python packages over the years and you will find a lot of tracks on the internet. There is a new system coming called wheel, but for now stick with pip (ubuntu also has many of these packages, but I find it better to try and not to mix package managers. Use your choice; mine is pip.

**** Virtual Environments
     To come. 
** Session 5 R
*** R
    1. Test for R from a terminal.
       - open terminal
       - type ~r~ then ~enter~
       - type ~2 + 2 enter~
       - Do you see 4?
       - type ~quit()~ to exit.
    2. Test for R in Emacs
       - ~M-x R~
